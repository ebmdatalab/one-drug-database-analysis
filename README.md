# Analysing the impact of the One Drug Database on OpenPrescribing

![status](https://github.com/ebmdatalab/one-drug-database-analysis/workflows/Notebook%20checks/badge.svg)

The BSA publish the [Detailed Prescribing Information](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/prescription-data/prescribing-data/detailed-prescribing-information) dataset monthly, which contains the number of items prescribed of each presentation for each practice.  In 2020 they are changing the underlying database which produces this dataset.  This is called the [One Drug Database project](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/important-information-drug-data), and these changes will affect the Detailed Prescribing Information dataset that we use.
